# Geometry Visualizer
**Geometry Visualizer** is a Python-based project that provides a convenient way to visualize geometric shapes and perform calculations related to them. This tool aims to assist users in understanding and exploring various geometric concepts in an interactive and intuitive manner.

## Features

- Visualize geometric shapes such as circles, triangles, squares, and rectangles.
- Calculate properties of shapes, including area, perimeter, and other relevant measurements.
- Interactive interface to input and modify shape parameters.
- Support for both 2D and 3D geometry.
- Customizable display options, including color, size, and style of shapes.
- Ability to save and load shape configurations for later use.
- Extensible architecture for adding new shape types and calculations.
